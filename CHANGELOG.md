## [3.10.0] - 2026-01-29

- Added option to disable running lua-ls (`lua_ls_backend = "disable"`) for cases when
  only manual documentation is required ([#47] by [@pieterlexis]).

## [3.9.0] - 2026-01-23

- Fixed LaTeX build and improved rendering of multiline signatures in LaTeX ([#46]).

## [3.8.1] - 2025-12-08

- Added LuaLs 3.16.0 to the list of known broken releases ([LuaLS#3301]).

## [3.8.0] - 2025-12-03

- Added support for Sphinx 9.

- Added `lua_ls_skip_versions` config option to selectively avoid certain language server
  releases.

## [3.7.0-post1] - 2025-11-14

- Minor documentation tweaks.

## [3.7.0] - 2025-11-14

- Fixed parsing of `@see` annotations with LuaLs backend.

- Fixed parsing of EmmyLua output after they removed `classDefaultCall` setting.

## [3.6.0] - 2025-10-17

- Adjusted styles for links in object signatures to match those produced by python domain.

- Releases are no longer uploaded to test version of PyPi.

## [3.5.0-post1] - 2025-10-03

- Migrated documentation to Read the Docs.

- Moved repository to [sphinx-contrib](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib) organization.

## [3.5.0] - 2025-10-03

- Added `autodata`, `autoattribute`, `autoclass`, and other `auto*` directives.

  They work like `autoobject`, but apply their doctype to the documented object (if
  `!doctype` was set in source code, it shouldn't conflict with the used directive).

  They also allow overriding object's signature, which may be useful when automatically
  generated signature is too long.

- Added `lua_ls_max_version` config option to safeguard against incompatible changes to
  documentation export format.

- Fixed a few more minor bugs in highlighting of Lua types.

## [3.4.0] - 2025-09-28

- **Potential breaking change:** use `confdir` instead of `srcdir` as base path for
  `lua_ls_project_root`.

  Prior to this change, `lua_ls_project_root` was resolved relative to the directory
  containing source `.rst` files. Documentation, however, was saying that it's resolved
  relative to the directory with `conf.py`.

  This is not an issue, because in most projects `conf.py` and source `.rst` files are
  located in the same directory. Still, I've decided to be consistent with other Sphinx
  extensions and use `confdir` instead of `srcdir`.

  This is a breaking change, but I don't believe there are any projects that use separate
  `confdir` and `srcdir` (the only reason to do this is if you're hosting multiple
  documentation sites in the same repo.) For this reason, this change is released as a
  minor version change.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-09-28

- Added an option to extend list options (like `:exclude-members:`) without overriding
  defaults:

  ```rst
  .. lua:autoobject::
     :exclude-members: +foo
  ```

  Also added `:no-*:` options to ignore defaults.

- Improved display of members which use types instead of names, i.e. `[<type>]` ([#19] by
  [@bkoropoff]).

- Added a warning for situations when `lua_ls_project_directories` contains directories
  outside of the current VCS root.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-09-02

- Updated a few dependencies. Most notably, restricted `sphinx` to `<9`.

- Fixed dashes in types being parsed as type names ([#18] by [@bkoropoff]).

- Added normalization for function syntax (`fun() -> T` is converted to `fun(): T`).

- Done some internal refactorings.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-08-21

- Added pygments lexer for Lua that highlights documentation tags.

- Added option to control maximum signature length before wrapping.

- Sphinx's nitpicky mode will no longer emit warnings for cross-references in signatures.

- Fixed generation of URL anchors to avoid duplicates.

- Fixed some edge cases in parsing of type expressions.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-26

- **Breaking change:** changed how `apidoc` generates file names to avoid collisions.

- Supported [EmmyLua] as an alternative backend for documentation export.

  EmmyLua was recently re-implemented in Rust, and its new language server provides some
  substantial benefits:

  - it has stronger and more flexible type system,
  - it handles aliases and enums way better than LuaLs,
  - it supports namespaces,
  - it exports way more metadata, including function overloads and class constructors,
  - you don't have to annotate modules with `@class` and `!doctype` anymore.

  I plan to use EmmyLua as the default language server since *v4.0.0*.

- Long object signatures are now broken into multiple lines.

- Supported using arbitrary types as object names, i.e.:

  ```rst
  .. lua:data:: [integer]: string
  ```

- Added `:globals:` flag for the `lua:autoobject` directive. It will allow automatically
  documenting global variables defined in a module.

- The `lua:autoindex` directive now lists globals defined in a module.

- Added support for documenting class constructors:

  ```rst
  .. lua:class:: Foo(a, b, ...)
  ```

- Added directive for enums.

- Supported generic parameters for functions, classes, aliases and enums:

  ```rst
  .. lua:class:: Foo<T>
  ```

- Improved linking to Lua language documentation to take into account whether an item is
  supported for the given Lua version.

- Added the `lua:lua` role to compensate for MySt not supporting default roles.

  If Lua is your primary domain cross-referencing from markdown can be done like this:

  ```md
  Reference to a {lua}`logging.Logger.info`.
  ```

- Added the `lua:other-inherited-members` directive and `:inherited-members-table:` flag
  for the `lua:autoobject` directive.

  These allow listing all members that were inherited by a class but weren't documented
  within the class body (see [#3]).

- Supported markdown output for `apidoc`.

- Added option to separate module members into their own files for `apidoc`.

### Migrating to 3.0.0

- If you're using `apidoc`, you'll need to update links to your documentation.

- You'll need to explicitly specify which language server to use by including
  `lua_ls_backend` to your `conf.py`.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-04-12

- Fixed documentation not being rebuilt after changing lua source code.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-03-16

- **Breaking change:** don't implicitly convert classes that're derived from `table` to
  modules. Users should use a `!doctype` comment instead.

- **Breaking change:** disallow nesting modules inside classes.

- Added `autoindex` directive.

- Added `apidoc` functionality.

- Improved test coverage and fixed found bugs.

### Migrating to 2.0.0

In your Lua code base, perform global replace by regexp:

```
^(\s*)---\s*@class\s*(.+): table$
```

to

```
$1--- !doctype module
$1--- @class $2
```

Make sure that you only use `!doctype module` on the top-level tables that can be imported
via `require`. On other objects, use `!doctype table` instead, otherwise you'll get errors
that modules are not allowed within other objects.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-11

- Added support for `!doc` and `!doctype` comments.

- Added `:include-protected:` and `:include-package:` options for `lua:autoobject`.

- Allowed referring `lua:const` objects from `lua:attr` role.

- Fixed a bug when default options would not properly propagate when using
  `lua:autoobject` with `:recurse:`.

- Fixed a bug when `lua:autoobject` would deduce incorrect module paths when applied to
  non-toplevel modules.

- Fixed a bug when docstring for a class would be used for undocumented function
  parameters that have this class as their type.

- Fixed types when `lua:autoobject` would infer incorrect types for `data`.
